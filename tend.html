<h1># TEND</h1>

<h2>## Overview</h2>
<p>
Tend, is a digital platform we designed to assist people living with dementia. Our primary goal was to foster connections with caregivers and amplify positive emotions, while simultaneously decreasing stress and anxiety. In October 2022, our dedicated team was commissioned to create a digital toolkit. This toolkit aimed to explore how bio-experiential technology could support the dementia community and their caregivers. Collaborating closely with Harvard Medicine and Massachusetts General Hospital, as a designer, I found myself navigating unfamiliar territory. I heavily leaned on the expertise and guidance of subject matter experts during the discovery phase. As the project kickoff approached, I had the unique opportunity to lead a multi-day design workshop, navigating doctors, scientists, researchers, and healthcare practitioners through a Lean UX kickoff and a series of design thinking exercises.

<h2>##Problem Space</h2>
<p>
Defining the problem space for Tend was a complex process, as it required a deep understanding of the breadth of experience for dementia patients. It quickly became clear that this community faced a wide array of concerns. Two particularly prominent issues were their ability to navigate a digital product and the emotional challenges they often faced, including feelings of disconnectedness, frustration, shame, a lack of safety, and an absence of meaningful connection.

In addition to patient experience, our design kickoff highlighted that caregiver experience was also a major part of the problem space. Caregivers often struggled with maintaining relationships while providing care, a lack of appropriate care resources, and issues related to equitable access to necessary services and supports.

All these factors outlined the problem space that Tend aimed to address. In designing Tend, we were mindful of these challenges and aimed to create an intuitive, supportive tool that could help both dementia patients and their caregivers.

<h2>## Approach</h2>

<p>Our approach to designing Tend was multi-faceted and iterative. We started with a design strategy centered around world building and connecting to creativity. This was a conscious choice, as we found that these activities induced less stress compared to nostalgic or memory-based activities. The world building approach also facilitated physical representations that improved way finding.

We began with early prototyping using wireframes, which served as a visual guide representing the skeletal framework of the product. This enabled us to lay out the structure and visualize the flow of the app before delving into the finer details.

Subsequently, we conducted Evaluation and Usability Testing. This was crucial in ensuring our design was user-friendly and met the needs of our target users â€“ dementia patients and their caregivers.

Next, we moved to Alignment and Planning. This involved coordinating with various stakeholders, including our team, subject matter experts, and the client, to ensure we were all on the same page about the project's direction.

To further understand our users and their needs, we conducted Internal Interviews. We interacted directly with dementia patients and their caregivers. The insights gained from these interviews were invaluable to our design process.

Data Analysis was another critical part of our approach. We meticulously examined all the data we had collected, from user feedback to interaction data, to inform our design decisions.

Finally, we focused on Building out an Interface that could entice feelings of awe, connection, wonder, and creativity. We aimed to design an interface that was not just functional, but also emotionally resonant, to enhance the experience of our users.

<h2>## Outcomes</h2>
<p>

Our strategic communication plan was successfully implemented, ensuring effective communication of information and updates about Tend to all stakeholders. Our comprehensive user insights guided the product development process, informing decisions on the design and functionality of the platform.

We were able to develop targeted educational campaigns, reaching out to dementia patients and caregivers and educating them about the benefits and features of Tend. The outcome of these efforts was successful navigation of the platform by the users, increased connection between dementia patients and their caregivers, and decreased stress levels in the dementia community.

The pilot program for Tend was launched to the public in early 2024. The response was positive, confirming the effectiveness of our design approach and the relevance of Tend to the needs of the dementia community.

Moving forward, we are applying for further grants. The aim is to continue the pilot program, refine the platform based on the feedback received, and expand its reach. This will allow us to continue supporting the dementia community and their caregivers, fulfilling our goal of fostering connections and amplifying positive emotions.
