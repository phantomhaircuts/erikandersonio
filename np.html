    <h1>North Point</h1>
    <h2>## Overview</h2>
<p>
The Studio was commissioned to design a bio-experiential space for child care at North Point Health Center in Minneapolis. We conducted a community-lead design workshop for those who utilize the health center. The project involved conducting user interviews and implementing hybrid community-centered design methodologies. This approach allowed us to comprehensively understand the user journey from multiple perspectives and backgrounds. We explored both the physical and emotional experiences of families as they navigated the system. The insights gained from this study are invaluable in informing future designs and services that cater to the diverse needs of the North Point community.

<h2>
## Approach
</h2>
<p>
Our approach to UX research began with a series of journey mapping exercises. We conducted stakeholder interviews to better understand the perspective of different individuals involved in the health center. We developed personas to represent the diverse users of the center, which guided our design and decision-making process. We also carried out design studio sessions and design exercises to stimulate creative solutions and ideas. Usability testing was conducted to ensure our designs met user needs effectively and efficiently. Lastly, we implemented a hybrid card exercise developed in tandem with Yale's CANDLab. This allowed us to understand the journey of each community member through the health center with emotional granularity, providing us with a deep understanding of the user experience.

<h2>
## Outcomes
</h2>
<p>
The outcomes of our approach were multifaceted. Firstly, gaining comprehensive user insights allowed us to have a holistic vision of the needs, preferences, and pain points of the community members. This insight was crucial in shaping our design and strategy.

Secondly, our product development was guided by user feedback. We were able to pivot and adjust our design based on real-time input from the people who would be most affected by our decisions.

Thirdly, we developed a strategic plan that was informed by our user research. This plan will serve as a roadmap for the health center as they move forward, ensuring that their future initiatives align with the needs of their users.

Fourthly, our research provided valuable insights into the sentiments of community members. We were able to understand the emotions, attitudes, and perceptions of the users, which will greatly influence our future decisions.

Lastly, this process allowed us to cultivate relationships with the community members. We were able to build trust and foster a sense of collaboration, which will be instrumental in the successful implementation of our designs.
